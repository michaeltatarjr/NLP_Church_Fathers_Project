    """Within natural language processing, there's always a need to process text in some way. Included here is a comparison of 4 common text processing decisions, using a Jaccard Similarity and displayed as a dendrogram.
    
A **Jaccard Similarity** is a statistic used for gauging the similarity and diversity of sample sets. It measures the similarity between finite sample sets and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets. 
    
A **dendrogram** is a tree-like diagram that illustrates the arrangement of clusters formed by hierarchical clustering. It's commonly used to visualize the relationships between objects or samples in a dataset based on their similarity or dissimilarity.
